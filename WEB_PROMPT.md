Create a modern, professional marketing website for Talrik, a productivity app available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Requirements:
1. Build a single-page marketing site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. Design should be clean, modern, and conversion-focused with smooth animations
3. Use a cohesive color scheme that feels premium and tech-forward

Sections to include:
- Hero section with compelling headline, subheadline, and prominent CTA buttons for iOS and macOS App Store
- Features showcase with 4-6 key features, each with icons and descriptions
- Device screenshots section showing Talrik on iPhone, iPad, and Mac (create placeholder images or use mockup generators)
- Benefits section explaining why users should choose Talrik
- Pricing/Download section with App Store badges and links
- Footer with social links and basic info

Technical requirements:
- Responsive design that works beautifully on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Use modern CSS (flexbox/grid) for layouts
- Add smooth scroll animations as elements come into view
- Include App Store download badges (use official Apple badges)
- App Store links should be: 
  * iOS: https://apps.apple.com/app/talrik/id[YOUR_APP_ID]
  * macOS: https://apps.apple.com/app/talrik/id[YOUR_MAC_APP_ID]
  (Note: Replace [YOUR_APP_ID] with actual IDs)

For screenshots/mockups:
- Generate placeholder mockups or use a service like Mockuphone or Screely
- Show 3 device mockups: iPhone 15 Pro, iPad Pro, and MacBook Pro
- Each should display a clean interface showcasing Talrik's core functionality

Style preferences:
- Modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- Generous white space
- Subtle gradients or glass morphism effects
- High contrast for readability
- Professional photography or abstract backgrounds

Please create all necessary files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) and organize them in a clean project structure. Include comments in the code explaining key sections.
